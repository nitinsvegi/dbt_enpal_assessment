# These vars define the target schemas for models in each layer:
# - stg_schemas: staging models
# - int_schemas: intermediate models
# - rep_schemas: reporting models
# The macros (custom_schema + generate_schema_name) use these vars
# to build each model in the correct schema.

# In this example config, we tell dbt to build all models in the example/
# directory as views. These settings can be overridden in the individual model
# files using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.
